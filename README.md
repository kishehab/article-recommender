# NewsK: Personalized News Recommendation Platform ðŸ“°
![NEWSK](docs/NEWSK.png)

This web application leverages state-of-the-art AI and NLP to offer personalized news recommendations based on user preferences. By utilizing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating both the MIND and SaudiNewsNet datasets, NewsK delivers an interactive experience that continuously evolves with new trends and user behavior.

## Features

- **Personalized Topic Selection**: Users can select their preferred news topics from a wide range of categories and subcategories.
- **Multi-Language Summarization**: The platform supports English and Arabic summaries using GPT-3, BART, and AraBERT.
- **Full Article View**: Users can access the full news article from the original source.
- **Related News Recommendations**: Get relevant news recommendations based on content similarity and time-relevance.
- **User Behavior Tracking**: Tracks user interactions to offer more personalized recommendations in the future.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion and Preparation**:
   - Both the MIND and SaudiNewsNet datasets are ingested and stored in MongoDB for efficient querying. ETL processes are used to extract relevant fields like Title, Category, Date, and URL.

2. **Summarization**:
   - LLMs generate concise summaries in both English and Arabic. GPT-3 is used for English news, while AraBERT is utilized for Arabic content.

3. **User Topic Selection**:
   - Users choose topics from predefined categories. LLMs and topic modeling further classify news into subcategories.

4. **Content-Based Recommendations**:
   - Using embeddings from models like SentenceTransformers for English and AraBERT for Arabic, the platform calculates cosine similarity to recommend articles.

5. **User Behavior Tracking and Recommendations**:
   - The platform keeps track of the user's interaction to improve future recommendations through a feedback loop.
